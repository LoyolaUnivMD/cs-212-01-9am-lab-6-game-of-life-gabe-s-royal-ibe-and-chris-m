Method:
advanceTime(newxposition, newyposition)
  Set index [newxposition], [newyposition] in the array grid to a slashed box //Set the cell as alive
  For int i = 0, i < grid.length, i++
      For int j = 0, j < grid[].length, j++
        set int count to 0 //Call value to check life count around the cell
        if (grid[i+1][j] = "/") //Check for cell right
          count += 1
        if (grid[i-1][j] = "/") //Check for cell left
          count +=1
        if (grid[i][j+1] = "/") //Check for cell above
          count +=1
        if (grid[i][j-1] = "/") //Check for cell below
          count +=1
        if (grid[i+1][j+1] = "/") //Check for cell diagonal right down
          count +=1 
        if (grid[i-1][j-1] = "/") //Check for cell diagonal left up
          count +=1
        if (grid[i+1][j-1] = "/") //Check for cell diagonal right up
          count +=1 
        if (grid[i-1+[j+1] = "/") //Check for cell diagonal left down
          count +=1
        if count not equal to 2 or 3
          set grid[i][j] to empty box  //Kill the cell if under or overcrowded
